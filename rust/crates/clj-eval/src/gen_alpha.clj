;; gap-122 slice F1: a narrow port of clojure.spec.gen.alpha (upstream
;; spec.alpha-0.6.249, clojure/spec/gen/alpha.clj, 227 lines) over a
;; self-contained seeded RNG, covering the generator surface spec
;; itself uses. No test.check is ported; generator fns answer plain
;; values (no rose trees, no shrinking — that is slice I).
;;
;; Port adaptations (see docs/gap-122/slice-F1.md for the full list):
;; - No syntax-quote and no `::auto-resolve` anywhere in this file:
;;   the port reads a whole load batch before evaluating it, so both
;;   would qualify against the *requiring* namespace instead of this
;;   one (the spec_alpha.clj precedent).
;; - Core fns shadowed by generator defs are always referenced via
;;   the `c` alias (`c/map`, `c/double`, ...), so file order can stay
;;   bottom-up without surprises.
;; - `generator?` is private `satisfies?` over a one-method protocol
;;   (the port cannot `instance?` record classes).
;; - `RuntimeException.` construction is `ex-info` with identical
;;   messages (the spec_alpha.clj precedent).
;; - Seed streams do not match the JVM; `ratio`/`double` edge
;;   distributions are approximate; `uri?` has no builtin (no host
;;   URI constructor); `inst?` covers 1970-2100 only. All pinned by
;;   `rust/crates/clj-eval/tests/gen_alpha.rs`.
