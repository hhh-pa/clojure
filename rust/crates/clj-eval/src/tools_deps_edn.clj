;; gap-124 slice 1: port of clojure.tools.deps.edn
;; (org.clojure/tools.deps.edn 0.9.57, edn.clj) over string paths
;; and the `clojure.tools.deps.util.port` substrate (no
;; java.io/Reader/clojure.string here).
;;
;; Port adaptations (see docs/gap-124/slice-1.md A1/A2/A5/D1/R3):
;; - `read-edn` takes a string, not a Reader (A1); callers `slurp`
;;   first. Error *shapes* match upstream (ex-info + `:path`);
;;   message *texts* are port-canonical (R3).
;; - `validate` is hand-written: spec.alpha lacks
;;   `s/keys`/`s/or`/`s/merge`, so the specs.clj grammar verdicts
;;   are encoded directly (A2). Same accept/reject verdicts, with
;;   one deliberate narrowing: a present coord-kind key must be
;;   well-typed (`{:local/root 42}` is rejected — a spec-letter
;;   reading would accept it through the all-optional `:git`
;;   branch of the `s/or`, but BDD scenario 5 pins rejection).
;; - `canonicalize` walks maps/vectors only (A5 — the grammar has
;;   no maps under other nodes on valid input, and `read-deps`
;;   validates before canonicalizing).
;; - `root-deps` is the embedded value `{}` (D1 — the port binary
;;   IS the runtime, so the port root carries no defaults).
;; - Path joins pin `/` and the stderr warning pins `\n` (no
;;   `File/separator` / `line.separator` here); `user.home` reads
;;   `$HOME` (then `%USERPROFILE%`, then the cwd).
;; - Opts arrive `& opts` and normalize through `as-opts` (kwargs
;;   or a single map — upstream's own `read-deps` passes a map).
;; - No syntax-quote or `::keywords` anywhere (the loader reads
;;   the whole file before evaluating it — the spec_alpha.clj
;;   discipline).
