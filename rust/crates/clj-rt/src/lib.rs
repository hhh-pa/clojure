//! AOT runtime archive for compiled Clojure binaries (T1174 S8B).
//!
//! [`abi`] exposes the `extern "C"` helper ABI over opaque `*mut
//! Value` boxes; [`runtime`] holds the process-global booted
//! evaluator the primitive helpers delegate to. The crate links
//! LLVM-free (`clj-eval + clj-value` only) so built binaries stay
//! small and link anywhere.
//!
//! Ownership (S8 plan D7/D8): helper arguments are consumed, the
//! return is owned, [`abi::rt_clone`] borrows, [`abi::rt_drop`]
//! frees, and generated code clones locals on every use and drops
//! all frame slots at scope end. Fallible helpers return null on
//! error (after printing `path:line:col: Class: message`); the
//! generated code null-checks and exits 1 — the library itself
//! never exits, so every line stays unit-coverable.

// The `usize` FFI widths assume a 64-bit host (R1 finding 8):
// refuse a 32-bit build at compile time (costs no coverage).
#[cfg(not(target_pointer_width = "64"))]
compile_error!("clj-rt requires a 64-bit host (usize FFI widths)");

// The shims stay out of the libtest binary: their `#[no_mangle]`
// names would collide with the rlib copies linked into the
// integration binaries (same symbol, different compilation), and
// llvm-cov drops the merged records as mismatched. Unit tests
// never call shims (they pin `runtime` directly); integration
// tests link the normal rlib, where the shims exist.
